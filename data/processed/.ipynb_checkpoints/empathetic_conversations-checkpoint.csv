I picked up my son from daycare today and they said another kid had pushed him over and taken his toy.,Ah.. so it's that kind of situation. Yeah_comma_ it can be one thing if it's just something where kids are acting like kids_comma_ and you can't physically intervene in time. But it's another if you think it's neglect and that they're not responding appropriately to the situation. I would trust your judgment. I hope everything ends well with it though! I'm sure you gave your child lots of love afterward.

It really freaks me out and will give me bad dreams.,Yeah_comma_ I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience_comma_ I would imagine.

This is not the image I wanted to have at my job...,If they know you_comma_ they should know better.

I've owned 3 birds in the past 10 years and my 3rd bird just died last night. I didn't realize how much it would crush me. They were my buddies.,Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea_comma_ as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void_comma_ but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors.

Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay.
I left my wallet and home and went grocery shopping. What a nightmare,It was sych a waste if time
I was a bit irritated when the police bothered me the other night when I was simply walking. They do this a lot here. Seems like I can't ever go walking at night without them rolling up as if they don't have a million other things to do.,Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.
It can be hard to wake up sometimes when you live alone. It's like..Oh...yeah. You know?,The past 2 weeks. It's a change. better then abuse though
Just got a new job after being without one for a couple months now.,What kind of job is it?
The mechanic who came to fix our air conditioner overcharged us by $200.,Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others

I went to an Italian restaurant earlier for dinner.  It was pretty good.,I had the Pasta Puttanesca.
There's nothing like being in your house after all your relatives have left after coming over for a long weekend visit. It's nice to see them_comma_ but once the frenetic energy is done with and you can kick your feet up... it's rewarding.,Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute :)
I am looking forward to getting a new vacuum on Tuesday. I haven't bought a new vacuum in years. It's long overdue.,I hear you! But some of us like a good machine. Personally I like Kirbys best and the old kind from Ebay etc. They work better then anything. Sharks work pretty good too. I guess we gals might think of cleaning tools like cars lol
I almost got hit by a semi truck today on the highway. It scared me half to death.,Well_comma_ that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?
My son has been having stomach pain for months now and the doctors can't figure out what it is. They basically say he has to get worse for them to find a diagnosis if some new problem comes up. I'm so scared.,You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office_comma_ but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!
There is a little cat I tried to help last night. He ran when my dog charged at him though and I am scared of what has happened to him. A lot of cats get hit around here,That sucks.

We were having a big family gathering and dinner today_comma_ and one of my nephews_comma_ who's four_comma_ wasn't feeling well. But his parents kept trying to force him to eat something anyway_comma_ and were being short-sighted. Well_comma_ the poor fella ended up puking onto his plate and ending everyone's appetite.,Yea_comma_ they're his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child.
My friend worked really hard this semester. I'm sure he'll do great.,That's a good way to look at it_comma_ to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself_comma_ or just working?
I didn't get a chance to make dinner for my date_comma_ so I got her McDonalds.,Well_comma_ there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you_comma_ then she sounds like a keeper!
My husband is coming home after a year abroad in the Army.  I'm about to burst I'm so happy!,Oh you have kids_comma_ too? They're going to be so happy!

My mom and I were talking about atarting a non profit that helps kids get clothing and other essentials.,Hopefully we can get it going.
I found my gold fish floating at the top of the fish tank dead last week.  I am absolutely hurt over it.,Wow. Im sorry
I am ok with being average in life.,We are all average until circumstances require us to be extraordinary.
Learned earlier today that I had been drinking all day out of a cup that had been used earlier by someone who has bronchitis. I'm hoping it's not too contagious... Why can't people properly clean and put things away so I don't confuse dirty dishes with clean dishes!,That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
ended up getting a pizza from Costco. I'm so hungry.,Yeah_comma_ I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still_comma_ I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.
MY friend used my car all day today and didnt even put any gas in it. She left trash in it too,I know. She lost that privilege
I just bought a lawn mower because mine broke and the grass was getting so long. I barely had it 3 days when my shed was broken into and it was stolen! I'm so irate!,I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
My father and brother are in a serious conflict with each other right now_comma_ as my father has complained about the way my brother raises his son. Obviously it's a really stressful_comma_ tenuous situation and I have no idea who's side to take_comma_ and I'm worried it will lead to them not wanting to keep in touch anymore.,It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.
I woke up one morning and found a puppy in my bed.  I wasn't expecting that!,That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
I lent my car to my 17-year-old sister today. She left at 10 in the morning and it's midnight_comma_ and she still isn't back with it. I trust her mostly_comma_ but she hasn't been driving for long_comma_ and it makes me nervous thinking of her out there on the road.,I'm glad you're going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.
Just moved and there is a pier near where I live.,Sometimes it means increased work commute_comma_ or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!
I won a year of unlimited pizza. I'm so psyched.,It will save you a lot of money too
I am so ready to light a candle and bingewatch,Hope you find something you like.
I saw firsthand today how caring my cousin can be with children. She was being patient and cooperative with my unruly and difficult two-year-old nephew_comma_ and she's only 13-years-old herself. I was pretty proud of how she handled the difficult situation_comma_ and it made me imagine her as a mother in the future.,Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up
I am so tired of my friends flaking on plans. They are so unreliable,That's really good advice. I can have a better time with other peopl.
There's a battle of the bands going on. I hope my favorite band gets so far.,I love a good rock concert!
